How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier to comapare with clear regions to check instead of looking at the whole file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can come to know the list of changes and why they were made gives better undertanding

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual comit eEnsures only tested code is saved , auto commit is useful for non dev puposes where there is a risk of loss of data 
	due to power or system failure

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    GIt works by snapshots + code possibility that many files are related and google docs works commit per doc + generally files are not related

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   Use git log to view all the modifications (verbose) that was done on a file
   Use Git diff to view changes specific to 2 versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Since there is always a saved version that worked fine, in case of bugs we can always revert to the saved version and then do a diff to 
	find the cause of the bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to learn how to use GiT for EBS
	how to use GIT for web development so that I can use in PaaS
